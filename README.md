# Kaggle-House-Prices
Collection of different ML-Models used on the House-Prices challenge of Kaggle.
Designed as an experimental environment and not cleaned.

Current project is the design of a complex pipeline to bundle several pre-processing steps.
Implemented:
  1. categorical data: dropNA, fillNA, feature selection
  2. numerical data: dropNA, fillNA, feature selection

WIP:
  1. create new columns: sum of other columns
